# === Project-specific =======================================================
# Keep the project code, data and configuration tracked by default.
# Don't blindly ignore top-level folders that contain important code or data.

# Backend cleanup (ignore caches and DB files, but keep source code)

backend/wellness.db

# NOTE: `backend/intent_model_multi/` contains model integration code. Track the
# folder (do NOT ignore) so integration scripts are pushed. Binary model files
# themselves are ignored by the patterns below.

# Frontend cleanup

# Rasa: ignore build/cache and trained model bundles

# === Data / models / artifacts ==============================================
# IMPORTANT: `data/` and `data_structured/` are part of the project and are
# tracked. The following patterns ignore large binary checkpoints and archives
# while keeping metadata, scripts and small configs in the repository.

# Do not track common binary model weight files

# === Helpful notes ==========================================================
# If you need to include a specific model file or archive, add it deliberately
# with `git add -f path/to/file` and document why it is tracked in the repo.
# To inspect large files before committing, run `.
# scripts\list_large_files.ps1 -ThresholdMB 10` (PowerShell).
